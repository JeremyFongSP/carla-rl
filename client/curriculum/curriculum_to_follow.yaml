# Insert the experiment and poses to be trained on here.
# The double brackets indicate single experiment/pose pair
# The staggered single bracket represent a set of exp/pose pair on which
# curriculum.py will pick at random
# Do not forget the empty list line when adding a new set (single
# bracket) of experiment/pose pairs

# The brackets are done as a hacky way to get the length of each sets
# eg: curriculum_training_set[current_set][specific_example][element]
# 1) current_set is eg: [[1, 1], [2, 5], [2, 9]],
# 2) specific_example is eg: [2, 5] from (1), eq to 0 if only 1 element
# 3) element is eg: 2 from (2)
